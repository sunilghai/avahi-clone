# This file contains static ip address <-> host name mappings. These
# can be useful to publish services on behalf of a non-avahi enabled
# device.
#
# Host names to be published via multicast DNS are expected to be fully
# qualified domain name. i.e ending in .local and single-label-names
# would be published using LLMNR.
#
# You can also specify LLMNR at the end of the entry, if you want a
# fully qualified domain name to be published using LLMNR
# (No restriction in format of FQDN in this case).

# See avahi.hosts(5) for more information on this configuration file!

# Examples:

# This entry would be published using mDNS [name ending with .local]
# 10.1.147.1 orange.local

# This entry would be published using LLMNR [single-label-name]
# 10.1.147.2 mango

# Specify LLMNR at the end of the line if you want FQDN to be published
# via LLMNR, like [without any restriction in FQDN]
# 10.1.147.3 abc.xyz.com LLMNR
# 10.1.147.4 mango.local LLMNR

# 2001::81:1 test.local
